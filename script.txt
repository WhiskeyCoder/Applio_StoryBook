Narrator: Ron Stoppable nods, ready to take on the challenge and trips over a rock, making a loud noise
Ron: KP! Uh, did anyone hear that?

Narrator: Dr Drakken laughs with a evil cackling, while shego smiles
Dr Drakken: With my latest invention, the Mind Control Ray, I'll finally rule the world!
Narrator: kim emergeces from the shadows, shaking her head
Kim: Not so fast, Drakken!
Dr Drakken: Kim Possible! How did you get past my impenetrable security?
Narrator: Ron stands up in a superman pose looking proud.
Ron: We've got skills. Right, Rufus?
Narrator: Rufus pops out of ron's pants pocket and says
Rufus: Huh-huh, yeah!

Narrator: kim fights shego kicking and punching while trying to shout to ron
Kim: Ron, the death ray!
Narrator: Ron races for the controls and starts to struggle with them, pressing random buttons
Ron: I'm on it, KP!
Narrator: In a comedy of errors, Ron accidentally activates the ray, but it backfires, affecting Drakken and Shego instead.
Narrator: Dr Drakken and shego both stumble and look dazed and confused.
Dr Drakken: What am I doing? Why do I suddenly want to donate to charity?
Shego: And I feel an urge to volunteer at a kitten sanctuary!
Narrator: Kim looks at them and smiles with a proud smirk
Kim: Looks like your plan backfired, Drakken.
Narrator: Ron lets out a relieved sigh and smiles back at Kim.
Ron: Phew, that was totally what I intended to do!
Narrator: With Drakken's plan thwarted, Kim and Ron make their escape, leaving the villain and his henchwoman to ponder their sudden altruistic impulses.
Narrator: Kim and Ron leave through the front door into the star filled night sky,
Kim: Another mission accomplished. What's next on the agenda?
Ron: I could go for a Naco. Saving the world works up an appetite!
